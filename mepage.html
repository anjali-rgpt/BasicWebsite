            <p>Hello and howdy to whoever is reading this glorious page. My name is Anjali Ragupathi.
                I was born in the beautiful month of October in a quaint little town called Kharkov, in Ukraine.
                My mum is Ukrainian, and my dad is Indian; both are medical professionals, although Mum doesn't really
                practice medicine these days.
                I have a little sister, who is entering the annoying stage of teen-hood and is every bit as snarky as I
                was
                during that time. We have a dog named Snoopy who is, coincidentally, a beagle. She doesn't fly a plane
                but
                she sure zooms around like one. That is our family.
            </p>

            <p>
                Over the course of my 19 years of existence, I have been shuttled among various locations, including,
                but
                not limited to Coimbatore, Pattambi and Ooty. Coimbatore is and always has been what I consider home,
                mostly
                because it's so familiar, and it's the place where I've lived the longest.
                There is no altitude sickness involved. There are plenty of amazing food spots.
                The weather is pretty decent most of the time, except in summer, when it feels like the devil is
                visiting
                with his armada of fiery charcoal pits.
                It's also pretty safe, most of the time, with a convenient public transport system and a
                semi-metropolitan
                lifestyle.
            </p>

            <p>
                I study Computer Science and Engineering at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. The campus is pretty green, and
                everything is within walking distance.
                Travelling here takes a good hour each way. The food here...isn't the best. The uniform...not the best
                either. Oh well.
            </p>

            <h3 class="headings" id="whatido">What I Do</h3>
            <p>
                I exist. Mostly.
            </p>
            <p>
                I spend my days trying to keep up with the dastardly syllabus that we have, whilst still maintaining a
                composed and sane state of mind.
                There are projects to be done, assignments to be finished, tests to prepare for. Most days, you don't
                really
                have time to do anything else. THe worst part is all the expectations that people place on your head.
                Quite
                annoying.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a very very tiny circle of friends who are excellent at comprehending the random things I come up
                with sometimes, and whose brainwaves usually sync with mine. THe easiest way to make new friends, for me
                is
                a two-subject thing:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Books, most frequently either Harry Potter, The Shadowhunter Chronicles or some other fantasy
                    situation
                </li>
                <li>Writing</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Speaking of writing, I maintain a blog specifically to rant, ramble and recount various scenarios from
                my
                life. There will be a link in the <a href="#contact">contact</a> page. Hope you enjoy it. In any case,
                writing has always been a significant part of my life, and I've been writing since I was 4, albeit the
                quality has definitely improved over the years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reading is just as important. Currently, I am highly inclined towards fiction of the fantasy kind, in
                particular, the work of one Brandon Sanderson ( <i>Mistborn,Way of Kings,</i>et.al). I enjoy classics
                and
                light reading like <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>, but I do not mind reading any other
                genre
                either. At college, I am involved in the book club and plan to organize enticing events to bring
                together
                fellow bibliophiles.
            </p>

            <p> I dabble in music, occasionally singing and playing the guitar, but none of this has been discovered by
                the
                public eye, thank goodness. I draw on occasion and doodle always, particularly in notebooks where I find
                I
                need more mental concentration. An interesting fact is that I am not mathematically inclined in the
                slightest, by interest, and yet I find myself in a course that relies heavily on this. Anyway.
                Supplementary
                hobbies involve travel ( it's amazing when you have funds ) - in particular, food tourism. I enjoy food,
                although my cooking skills leave much to be desired. Food writing and reviewing is what I'd consider one
                of
                my niches to be. Most importantly, sleeping is an art and one of my favourite ways to destress.
